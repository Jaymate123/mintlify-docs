## Why Am I Receiving These Emails?

You might receive an email from us indicating that your domain name is not eligible. This typically occurs if the ABN (Australian Business Number) associated with the domain is invalid or has been cancelled. Such cases often happen when you move to a new ABN/ACN but do not update the domain details accordingly.

In collaboration with auDA, we have implemented a change to enhance the eligibility validation process. This aims to reduce eligibility complaints and prevent the potential loss of invalid .au domains.

If a domain does not meet the necessary eligibility criteria—such as having an active ABN or ACN (Australian Company Number)—after an inbound transfer or renewal, we will notify the registrant via email. The registrant will then have 30 days to perform a [**Manual Change of Registrant**](https://ventraip.com.au/support-centre/manual-change-of-registrant-cor-process/) to update to a valid and eligible registrant, preventing suspension.

## How Can I Resolve This?

To resolve this issue, you need to perform a [Manual Change of Registrant](https://ventraip.com.au/support-centre/manual-change-of-registrant-cor-process/) to update to a valid and eligible registrant.

Learn more about the Change of Registrant process and how it works [here](https://ventraip.com.au/support-centre/completing-an-au-domain-change-of-registrant-cor/).

<Tip>
  If you have multiple domains affected by eligibility issues, you can include all of them in your email or eTicket. We can assist with changing the registrant for all affected domains simultaneously.

## What Documentation Do I Need?

When contacting our team, please provide one of the following documents that demonstrates the history of ownership transfer for the domain. The documentation must be **dated prior to the existing ABN becoming inactive**:

#### Accepted Documentation Types

**Sales Agreement**

- A copy of a sales agreement showing the business was sold or transferred.
- The agreement must clearly indicate that the current company/entity was acquired by the proposed company/entity.

**Signed Letter on Company Letterhead**

- A letter signed on official company letterhead stating that the domain has changed hands.
- The letter must explicitly specify the full domain name being transferred from one business to another.

**Other Valid Documentation**

- Any valid document demonstrating the change of ownership for the domain or business.
- This can include a Statutory Declaration outlining the transfer details, **signed by a Justice of the Peace or an authorised witness.**

### Alternative Option: Transfer of Domain Chain Form

If you cannot provide the above documentation, you may use the Transfer of Domain Chain Form. This is suitable when the current registrant no longer exists or lacks supporting documentation.

1. Download the [Transfer of Domain Chain Form](https://ventraip.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Transfer-of-Domain-Chain-Form.pdf).
2. Complete the form and include any supporting documents.

Once you have gathered the necessary documentation, **reply to the email** you received from us or contact us directly at [**policy@ventraip.com.au**](mailto:policy@ventraip.com.au). Our team will review your submission and proceed with the Change of Registrant.
