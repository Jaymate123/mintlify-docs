### 1. Verify Your Login Details

The most common reason for email client issues is incorrect login credentials.

- **Confirm your email address and password:** Ensure they are entered correctly without extra spaces or typos.
- **Test using Webmail:** You can verify your credentials easily by logging into your Webmail:
  - **Dedicated Email Hosting:** [https://ventraip.email](https://ventraip.email/)
  - **cPanel Email Hosting:** [https://webmail.yourdomain.com](https://webmail.yourdomain.com/)

If you can successfully access Webmail, your login details are correct.

### 2. Check Email Configuration Settings

Misconfigured settings can prevent your email client from syncing.

- **Incoming (IMAP) Settings:**
  - Server: `ventraip.email` (Dedicated) or `mail.yourdomain.com` (cPanel)
  - Port: `993`
  - Security: `SSL/TLS`
- **Outgoing (SMTP) Settings:**
  - Server: `ventraip.email` (Dedicated) or `mail.yourdomain.com` (cPanel)
  - Port: `465`
  - Security: `SSL/TLS`

Double-check your email client’s configuration against these settings.

### 3. Device and Software Troubleshooting

Occasionally, device-specific issues or software glitches can cause problems.

- **Restart your device:** Rebooting can resolve temporary glitches.
- **Disable VPN:** If applicable, turn off your VPN temporarily, as it may interfere with your email client connection.
- **Update your device and email client software:** Ensure you're running the latest version of your device operating system and email application.

### 4. Reset Your Email Password

If you suspect your password may be incorrect or forgotten, reset it easily:

- Follow our straightforward guide on resetting your Email Password [here](https://ventraip.com.au/support-centre/how-can-i-reset-my-email-password/).

Once reset, update your email client settings with the new password.

### 5. Remove and Re-add Your Email Account

Persistent syncing issues may be resolved by re-adding your account.

- Completely remove your email account from your email client.
- Restart the email client application.
- Re-add the email account, carefully entering all required details using the correct settings.

### 6. Check Firewall and Antivirus Settings

Firewalls and antivirus software can sometimes interfere with email syncing, if you run any additional firewalls or antivirus software on top of what comes pre-installed with your operating system, consider the following:

- Temporarily disable your antivirus software and firewall to check if they're causing connection issues.
- If disabling resolves the problem, adjust the settings in your security software to allow email client communication.

### 7. Inspect Storage Quotas

- Ensure your mailbox is not full. A full mailbox can prevent receiving new emails.
- You can verify your mailbox storage via Webmail or through cPanel (cPanel Email Accounts) or VIPcontrol (Dedicated Email Accounts)
