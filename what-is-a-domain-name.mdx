title: "What is a domain name?"

In the most simple way possible, a domain name can be described as an address on the internet. Every website on the internet has an IP address which is a unique number identifier, but with so many of these numbers in existence and seemingly random, itâ€™s much easier to remember a domain name.

A domain name turns an IP address (such as 198.51.100.1) into [_yourwebsitegoeshere.com_](http://yourwebsitegoeshere.com), making it easier for you and your clients to reach your website. It also allows you to have your own personalised [yourname@example.com](mailto:yourname@example.com) email address.
